<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* Gatsby
* React Modal
* Scrollspy
* Smoothscroll-Polyfill

## Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new <site-name> https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-prologue
```

Then you can run it by:

```sh
cd gatsby-example-site
npm install
gatsby develop
```

### Personalization

Edit `config.js` to put up your details

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: 'Gatsby Starter Prologue', // <title>
  ...
  authorName: 'Anubhav Srivastava',
  heading: 'Web Developer',
  // social
  socialLinks: [
    {
      icon: 'fa-github',
      name: 'Github',
      url: 'https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava',
    }
    ...
  ],
};

```

### Deploying using Github page

`package.json` has a default script that uses `gh-pages` module to publish on Github pages. Simply running `npm run deploy` would publish the site on github pages.

Additionally, it also has [path-prefix](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) value set for gatsby config in `config.js`. Change `pathPrefix` to relevant path if your gatsby site is hosted on subpath of a domain, `https://theanubhav.com/somePath/`. If you are hosting it as root site, i.e, `https://theanubhav.com/` , remove the pathPrefix configuration.
