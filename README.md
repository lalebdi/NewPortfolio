<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is my porfolio site that I created using Gastby. Hope you like it.


* Gatsby is a static site generator.
* Fast, Safe and secure.
*  :smile:



### Built With

* Gatsby
* React Modal
* Scrollspy
* Smoothscroll-Polyfill
* Font-Awesome




### Prerequisites

### Personalization

Edit `config.js` to put up your details

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: 'Gatsby Starter Prologue', // <title>
  ...
  authorName: 'Anubhav Srivastava',
  heading: 'Web Developer',
  // social
  socialLinks: [
    {
      icon: 'fa-github',
      name: 'Github',
      url: 'https://github.com/leahwebdev',
    }
    ...
  ],
};

```

### Installation


1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lalebdi/myPortfolio
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Deploying using Github page

`package.json` has a default script that uses `gh-pages` module to publish on Github pages. Simply running `npm run deploy` would publish the site on github pages.

Additionally, it also has [path-prefix](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) value set for gatsby config in `config.js`. Change `pathPrefix` to relevant path if your gatsby site is hosted on subpath of a domain, `https://theanubhav.com/somePath/`. If you are hosting it as root site, i.e, `https://theanubhav.com/` , remove the pathPrefix configuration.
